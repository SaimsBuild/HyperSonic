Android App Prompt: Self-Discipline & Habit Tracker
App Name
HyperSonic
Core Concept
The app is a self-discipline and habit-building tool with a distinctive visual interface centered around a hexagonal progress system. Its primary functions are:
 * Daily goal setting and tracking.
 * Long-term habit creation and management.
 * A dedicated module for managing urges, specifically for breaking the habit of masturbation.
 * A calendar to visualize progress over time.
Visual and Interface
The app should have a fancy, modern, and clean interface. A core visual element is a hexagon that represents the user's overall progress, which will fill up or change color as the user completes tasks and habits. The UI should be intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.
Key Features
1. Daily Goals
 * Users can set a list of goals for the day.
 * Each goal is a simple checkbox that can be marked as complete.
 * A goal progress counter should be displayed on the main screen, showing how many daily goals have been completed (e.g., "3/5 goals completed").
 * At 12:00 AM (midnight), all daily goals should automatically reset.
2. Habit Tracker
 * Users can create custom habits (e.g., "Read 10 pages," "Go for a 15-minute run," "Meditate").
 * Habits are a bit different from daily goals. When a user creates a habit, it should be marked as "Active."
 * If a user completes a habit for a certain number of consecutive days, it "levels up" or gets a visual reward within the app.
 * If a user fails to complete a habit for a specified number of consecutive days, that habit is automatically canceled or marked as "Failed." The user would then need to restart the habit.
3. Urge Breaker
 * This is a dedicated feature designed to help users manage the urge to masturbate.
 * The main screen should have a prominent button that says "Urge Breaker" or something similar.
 * When the user clicks this button, a new screen appears with a list of pre-defined tasks (e.g., "Do 20 push-ups," "Take a cold shower," "Listen to a podcast," "Go for a quick walk").
 * The user can choose one of these tasks to distract themselves.
 * Completing an urge-breaking task should also contribute to their overall hexagon progress.
4. Calendar & Activity Log
 * The app will include a calendar view.
 * Each day on the calendar should be marked to reflect the user's activity. For example, a color or symbol could indicate a day with high activity (many goals/habits completed), low activity, or a day when the user used the urge-breaker feature.
 * This feature helps users visualize their discipline streak and see their progress over weeks and months.
5. Data and Storage
 * All user data must be saved locally on the device.
 * The app should not rely on any external databases or require an internet connection.
 * This ensures privacy and allows the app to function anywhere.
 * The app should be able to function offline.
6. Hexagon Progress
 * This is the central visual element on the main screen.
 * The hexagon's progress bar or segments should fill up based on the user's activity (completed goals, habits, and urge-breaking tasks).
 * The hexagon can serve as a quick, at-a-glance visualization of the user's overall discipline for the day.
The name HyperSonic adds a sense of speed and progress, which fits perfectly with the app's goals. This prompt is now ready to be used.
